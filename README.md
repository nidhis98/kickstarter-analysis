# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Overview of Project

  The purpose of this analysis was to reformat and present the data in a more readable and meaningful manner for Louise. Using excel, we were able to consolidate a vast number of figures and statistics to a clearer depiction of successful and unsuccessful outcomes. After reviewing the revised data, Louise will have a stronger understanding for plays which thrived, as well as areas of improvement.
  
Analysis and Challenges

  The Kickstarter excel has various tabs, each using distinct sections of information from the original data set to better explain trends. For example, we’ve created two separate tabs named “Category Statistics” and “Subcategory Statistics” which display the outcomes of theater and plays using pivot tables and charts. Louise will find this especially useful, as she can filter the data to exhibit successful, live, canceled and failed data with an associating graphic to visually display trends overtime. 

Results

  A conclusion which can be drawn from the “Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date” is that there was a spike of successful outcomes when the launch date was in the months of May and June. As portrayed in the pivot table and chart, May had a success rate of 111 plays and June had a similar result of 100 plays. Secondly, another conclusion which can be made is that towards the very end of the year, the success rate and fail rate were almost identical. The pivot chart below shows the successful marker and failed marker meeting at almost the same value in the month of December. The success rate in this month was 37, while the fail rate was 35.

    Possible limitations of this dataset may include that it is quite large, which means there is room for error. In addition to this, any incomplete values which are missing from the data may affect the outcome. This dataset also includes some outliers. Outliers may affect the mean specifically, by skewing the data so the mean is not completely accurate of the figures.
    
    Other possible graphs or charts which may be useful to create using this dataset, is the average donation over the course of the year. This graph would depict trends, if any, on the amount donated each month for different plays. For a deeper analysis, the type of play can also be considered to see how that affects the donator’s amount.
